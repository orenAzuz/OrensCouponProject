					<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.</p>
					<p>Cream shortening and butter until light and fluffy, gradually adding sugar. Beat well at medium speed of an electric mixer. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition.</p>
					<p>Sift flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa and cinnamon together. Add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Mix just until blended after each addition. Stir in vanilla and almond extracts.</p>
